⭐️001-DiceRoller: This is the first Android app I created. It is aimed changing the images by pressing a button on the page. 
Hence, whenever you press “Roll” button, two dices display randomly. Whenever you press “Clean” button, two dices will be gone on the page.

⭐️002-PassingActivity: In this project, it is aimed transition of pages when press buttons by using “Intent” and also closing app by overriding “onBackPressed()” in MainActivity when back button pressed.
